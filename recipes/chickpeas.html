            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Roasted chickpeas are a delicious, crunchy snack that’s both healthy and easy to make. Simply drain and dry canned chickpeas, toss them with olive oil, salt, and spices like smoked paprika, garlic powder, and cumin, then roast
                them at 200°C (400°F) for about 25-30 minutes. Shaking the tray halfway ensures even crispiness. These high-protein, fiber-rich bites can be enjoyed on their own, sprinkled over salads, or mixed into trail mix. Customize with sweet,
                spicy, or herby flavors for variety. They store well in an airtight container, making them a great make-ahead snack for busy days.</p>

    <b>Ingredients</b>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (400g) chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>½ tsp garlic powder (optional)</li>
        <li>½ tsp smoked paprika (optional)</li>
        <li>¼ tsp ground cumin (optional)</li>
        <li>¼ tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>Pinch of cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Instructions</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).</li>
        <li>Pat the chickpeas dry using a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. The drier they are, the crispier they’ll get. Remove any loose skins if desired.</li>
        <li>Toss with oil and seasoning in a bowl until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Spread on a baking sheet in a single layer.</li>
        <li>Roast for 25-30 minutes, shaking the pan halfway through, until golden and crispy.</li>
        <li>Cool for 5-10 minutes before eating (they get crispier as they cool).</li>
    </ol>
