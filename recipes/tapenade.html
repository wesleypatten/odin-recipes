    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Olive tapenade is a rich, savory spread made from black olives, capers, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil, blended into a chunky or smooth consistency. Anchovies and thyme enhance its depth of flavor. This Mediterranean classic is perfect as a dip for bread, a topping for grilled meats, or a flavorful pasta addition. Quick to prepare in under 10 minutes, it offers a balance of briny, tangy, and umami notes. Store it in the fridge for up to a week for an easy, gourmet condiment. Variations include green olives, added nuts, or spicy chili flakes for an extra kick.</p>
